            My Personal Statement
        </h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Adrian Martinez and I am an undergraduate student at the 
            at the University of Central Florida. Pursuing a Bachelor's Degree of Science in 
            Information Technology. 
            
            <br><br>With this degree I would like to enter the technology 
            career field as a IT specialist for either software applications or hardware. 
            I view the IT career space as one with many oppurtunities to not only support 
            the next generation of technology. But an oppurtunity to gain a sense of 
            accomplishment from my work. 
            
            <br><br>With an extended background as a blue collar worker, there is always a sense 
            of accomplishment when you are part of a big team either developing, supporting, 
            finishing, or managing a project of any type. Whether its a small scope project 
            such as extending the broadband space a company's data communications can go. 
            To a huge project, requring multiple teams and multiple tasks to be done at 
            the same time to proceed to the next phase. As an IT specialist, that is my 
            main desire in the job space. 
            <br><br>
